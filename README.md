# Data Engineering Project
## By Owen Rose

#### Iteration 1
Due on 2/6/2020
for this Iteration, I wrote a Maven Project that 
would open a CSV file using OpenCSV which is a program 
used for reading said file. After it reads the file it
then prints out the contents of the file into the console
or output.


#### Iteration 2
Due on 2/12/2020
For this Iteration, I made a database and input what was on
the CSV file into the database. I then used a SELECT command
to output what is in the Database into the CSV file.
